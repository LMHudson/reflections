When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating. When you want to back up your local work to the cloud.
Why might you want always to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? If you are collaborating and the master version is local, you don't want to introduce changes without examining them.
Forking is a clone within github.
to add a file, git add FILENAME
to commit, git commit
to push to remote, git push -u origin master
forks are for collaboration; clones are for copying back and forth between the local repository and the remote; branches are for experimenting while preserving alternate versions.
